# Physics-Particle
This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline to classify high-energy physics particles as either **signal (s)** or **background (b)**.   The dataset contains particle measurements, and the task is to distinguish meaningful signal events from background noise â€” a common challenge in experimental physics.
